# On & Off personal website

Description |

Jiwon's brain(bulb) is On as a developer, it means she is active and energetic.
When she becomes just 'jiwon', her bulb is Off and is enjoying her time to recharge the battery for the next day.

This is my personal website (in-progress).
My idea is coming from a Korean's entertainment show called "On and Off".

Our life is greatly enthusiastic, but we need our me-time for a better life.
Having a balanced life is good to improve our productivity as well.

Flexibility | Security | Productivity
These 3 keywords are my values.

This program is managed by Jiwon Hwang.
Also, I am happy for any feedback :)
